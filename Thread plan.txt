	GUI
		gui duh
	
	HOST (butler)
		creates links between players
	
	CLIENT (2, 1 waiting on gui, 1 waiting on host)
		connects to a host
		tells host what player is doing
	
	SIMULATION (invokes the GUI, non blocking gets from client)
		calculates what is currently happening
		client tells this what this player and other players are "doing" in the game, and this calculates state.
